    <p2>Project Proposal: Audrey Nguyen</p2>
    <hr></hr>
    <br></br>
    <h1>Part I: Intro</h1>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Briefly describe your project idea (2-3 sentences)</li>
            <p2>I want to make a portfolio website. Something that showcases my work and a little bit about me.</p2>
        <li> Is this a website you intend to continue using beyond this class (e.g., a portfolio, a web page for a side-project)?</li>
            <p2>I intend to continue using this site in the future and hopefully build on it more.</p2>
        <li>Is this website a piece of art or design that you intend to include in your portfolio as a standalone work?</li>
            <p2>I don't think I want to go towards making this website a piece of art or something I'd include in my portfolio yet.</p2>
       <li>Is this website a chance to experiment with web code, without any concrete end goal? (If this is your answer, I encourage you to think of this website as a potential portfolio entry)</li>
            <p2>I do want this website to be complete enough that it's usable.</p2>
       <li>Is this website one large project, or multiple smaller projects?</li>
            <p2>One large project.</p2>
        
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <h1>Part 2: Why?</h1>
    <p1>
    <ol>
        <li>Why do you want to make this project?</li> 
            <p2>I want to have something that is completely customizable to what I need and to have something useful.</p2> 
        <li>What do you hope to learn from the process of creating it?</li>
            <p2>Being more confident with code, what makes a website more appealing?</p2>
        <li>What is your primary concern with this project: making something that is easy for an audience to navigate, or making something that focuses on your own experimentation with this medium? Include 3 or web sites here that help you think through what you want out of this project. Are there specific aesthetic elements on these pages you are interested in? 
        Is it the structure or aesthetic of the website as a whole that inspires you? If you're having trouble finding websites to draw inspiration from, let me know and we can find some together!</li>
            <p2> I don't have a super clear idea on how I view this and would appreciate looking at some websites since I'm not sure where to start but I was thinking about how could I make this easy to navigate and responsive, but also fun to look through, interactive? </p2>
    </ol>
    </p1>
    
    <br></br>
    <h1>Part 3: Technical</h1>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>To the best of your ability, write down some technical/code concepts you think you need to achieve your project.</li>
            <p2>Maybe transitions with animations? I don't want to go too far that I can't complete it.</p2>
        <li>As it is, can you imagine actually creating your project? If you sat down and started coding right now, do you think you'd be able to make it (or at least 90% of it?).</li>
            <p2>I think I'd be able to get most of it done. I'm not thinking of anything crazy at the moment.</p2>

    </ol>
