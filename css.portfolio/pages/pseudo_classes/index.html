    <div><h1>Hover over me to see Chihuahuas</h1>
    <p>In a 1520 letter, Hernan Cort√©s wrote that the Aztecs raised and sold little dogs as food. Colonial records refer to small, nearly hairless dogs at the beginning of the 19th century, one of which claims 16th-century Conquistadores found them plentiful in the region later known as <i>Chihuahua</i>. Small dogs such as <i>Chihuahua</i> were also used as living heating pads during illness or injury. Some believe this practice is where the idea of pain being transferred to animals from humans originated, which gave way to rituals such as burning the deceased with live dogs, such as the Techichi, to exonerate the deceased human's sins. <i>Chihuahua</i> as we know them today remained a rarity until the early 20th century; the American Kennel Club (AKC) did not register a <i>Chihuahua</i> until 1904.</p>
