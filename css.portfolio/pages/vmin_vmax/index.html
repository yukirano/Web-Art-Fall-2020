      <p>Dogs of any coat type may be identified as either "apple head" or "deer head" Chihuahuas. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation.[13]

        The Apple Head Chihuahua is known for having a round/apple-shaped head and a definite "stop" whereas a Deer Head Chihuahua "may" have a flatter head, thinner skull, but is unlikely to have a "stop" and will probably have a much longer nose. Their physical body shape is largely the same, except the Deer Head Chihuahua is known to have longer legs than other Chihuahuas.[21] The Deer Head Chihuahua tends to be larger in weight, where an Apple Head is more likely to keep their weight under ten pounds.
        
        Apple Head Chihuahuas are longer than they are tall and have shorter necks.[22] Deer Head Chihuahuas have longer ears than Apple Heads and their head also has a slope-shaped form. Both Apple Head and Deer Head can have short hair or long hair. They also both come in various different colors such as brown, black, tan, or white. Chihuahuas can show traits from both Apple Head and Deer Head.[23]
        
        "Deer Head Chihuahuas tend to have better health than Apple Heads, due to their longer noses".[This quote needs a citation] There is no scientific evidence that Apple Heads have a higher risk of getting respiratory issues, due to having a smaller airway. Deer Headed Chihuahuas are not allowed in the AKC due to not meeting the standards that Apple Heads do. Deer Head Chihuahuas are not allowed because they have a longer jaw line and a slope that connects their muzzle and head, creating a 45 degree angle instead of a 90 degree angle like the Apple Head.[24] Apple Heads are allowed in the AKC and meet the requirements due to having a smaller weight, having a rounder head, and also having a 90 degree angle formed by the muzzle to the forehead.[10]</p>
